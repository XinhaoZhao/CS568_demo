# Meeting Analyzer Evaluation Report
Generated on: 2025-05-04 19:02:43

## Executive Summary
This report evaluates the Meeting Analyzer tool across three key metrics: knowledge relevance, decision accuracy, and time to insight. The evaluation was conducted using three real-world meeting scenarios to ensure comprehensive testing.

## Technical Methodology
### Knowledge Relevance Measurement
Knowledge relevance is calculated using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization and cosine similarity:
1. All texts (response, transcript, and company resources) are converted to TF-IDF vectors
2. Cosine similarity is calculated between:
   - Response and transcript
   - Response and company resources
3. Dynamic weights are calculated based on query relevance to each source
4. Final score is a weighted average of these similarities, normalized using sigmoid scaling

### Decision Accuracy Measurement
Decision accuracy improvement is measured by comparing our tool's responses against baseline tools:
1. All responses (baseline, our tool, and ground truth) are converted to TF-IDF vectors
2. Cosine similarity is calculated between:
   - Baseline response and ground truth
   - Our tool's response and ground truth
3. Improvement ratio is calculated as: (our_similarity - baseline_similarity) / baseline_similarity

### Time to Insight Measurement
Time to insight is measured through simulated user interactions:
1. Each scenario is tested 5 times to ensure statistical significance
2. For each trial, we measure:
   - Initial upload and analysis time (0.5s)
   - Time for each query (0.3s thinking + 0.2s response)
3. Statistics calculated include:
   - Mean time across all trials
   - Standard deviation
   - Minimum and maximum times

## Knowledge Relevance Scores
Knowledge relevance measures how well our tool's responses match the relevant information from both meeting transcripts and company resources.
Mean Score: 0.741
Std Dev: 0.104

## Decision Accuracy Improvement
Decision accuracy improvement compares our tool's responses against baseline tools (Zoom+Confluence).
Mean Improvement: 2.898
Std Dev: 3.026

## Time to Insight Metrics
Time to insight measures how quickly users can get insights from the system.
Mean Time: 2.00 seconds
Std Dev: 0.00 seconds
