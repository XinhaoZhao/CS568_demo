# Meeting Analyzer Evaluation Report
Generated on: 2025-05-04 21:11:26

## Executive Summary
This report evaluates the Meeting Analyzer tool across four key metrics: meeting knowledge relevance, resource relevance, decision accuracy, and time to insight. The evaluation was conducted using three real-world meeting scenarios to ensure comprehensive testing.

## Technical Methodology
### Meeting Knowledge Relevance Measurement
Meeting knowledge relevance is calculated using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity:
1. Meeting analysis and transcript are converted to TF-IDF vectors
2. Cosine similarity is calculated between the meeting analysis and transcript
3. Score represents how well the analysis captures the key points from the meeting

### Resource Relevance Measurement
Resource relevance is calculated using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity:
1. Response and company resources are converted to TF-IDF vectors
2. Cosine similarity is calculated between the response and each resource
3. Maximum similarity score represents how well the response utilizes available resources

### Decision Accuracy Measurement
Decision accuracy is measured by comparing our tool's responses with baseline responses:
1. Calculate knowledge relevance score for baseline response
2. Calculate knowledge relevance score for our tool's response
3. Difference represents how much better/worse our tool performs in capturing meeting knowledge

## Meeting Knowledge Relevance Scores
Meeting knowledge relevance measures how well our tool's analysis captures the key points from the meeting transcript.
Mean Score: 0.496
Std Dev: 0.063

## Resource Relevance Scores
Resource relevance measures how well our tool's responses utilize available company resources.
Mean Score: 0.623
Std Dev: 0.102

## Decision Accuracy Difference
Decision accuracy difference measures how our tool's responses compare to baseline responses:
1. Calculate knowledge relevance score for baseline response
2. Calculate knowledge relevance score for our tool's response
3. Difference represents how much better/worse our tool performs in capturing meeting knowledge

Mean Difference: 0.257
Std Dev: 0.028

## Time to Insight Metrics
Time to insight measures how quickly users can get insights from the system.
Mean Time: 1.00 seconds
Std Dev: 0.00 seconds
