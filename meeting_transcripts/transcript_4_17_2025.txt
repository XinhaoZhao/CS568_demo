17:03:00 All right. So the next week basically the things that we want to accomplish is that we first want to finish project one that is building the front end of our application And so… And also, we want to discuss about
17:03:18 Other backend features that we want to add. And so ideally, we want to have like a group working on the front end And then we will have weekly meetings where we discuss about the backend features And so once these are finished, we're going to move on to backend development where we focus on
17:03:38 Implementing the features we discussed during these meetings?
17:03:44 And…
17:03:49 Yeah, so, and also we wanted to make sure that these backend features that we're going to do will meet the requirements of the users, which we will conduct a user study pretty soon and we're and we're going to need a group to do the user studies
17:04:08 And we're going to show the results to the backend development team where they can tailor these backend features And also working with the product management make sure that the backend features they implemented is going to meet the requirements of the
17:04:24 Desire to users that our company wants to attract
17:04:38 And so the next step beyond the backend feature will be integration. So full stack integration, front-end connects to the back end And make sure that each each functionality works as intended.
17:04:53 And so the team is going to cooperate on this one.
17:04:57 So roughly for each task we're going to need.
17:05:02 A couple of weeks, probably a month or so. Or the checkpoints In the end, we will discuss the next steps. So here it is for today's meeting.
