[Meeting Transcript – Project Phoenix Kickoff]
Date: April 20, 2025
Time: 10:00 AM – 11:00 AM
Participants: Alice (Project Manager), Bob (Frontend Dev), Carol (Backend Dev), Dave (QA)

Alice:
Good morning, everyone. Let’s get started on our Project Phoenix kickoff. The goal is to develop a web-based dashboard for real-time data visualization.

Bob:
Sounds great. What are the core features we want in the MVP?

Alice:
For now:
1. User authentication
2. Dashboard with live charts
3. API integration for external data sources
4. Admin panel for settings

Carol:
I can start working on the backend services and APIs. We’ll need endpoints for user login, data fetching, and admin controls.

Dave:
Once Carol has the initial endpoints ready, I’ll start writing test cases and set up the CI pipeline.

Bob:
Frontend side, I’ll begin with login and dashboard components. Will use React with Chart.js for the visualization.

Alice:
Perfect. Let’s outline action items.

Alice:
Thanks, everyone. Let’s reconvene next week and check progress.
