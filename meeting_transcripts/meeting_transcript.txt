Sarah: Good morning everyone! Thanks for joining our project kickoff for the mobile app redesign. Let's start by reviewing our objectives and timeline.
Marcus: Before we dive in, I want to emphasize how critical this project is for Q2. Our user retention has dropped 12% in the last quarter, and the executive team believes the outdated UI is a major factor.
Alex: I've completed some initial user research that supports that theory. I interviewed 15 users and ran a satisfaction survey with 200 responses. The main pain points were navigation complexity and visual inconsistency.
Priya: From a technical standpoint, we'll need to refactor significant portions of the frontend code. The current architecture wasn't built with scalability in mind.
Sarah: Thanks for that context. Here's what I'm proposing for our timeline: 2 weeks for design exploration, 1 week for user testing, 3 weeks for development, and 1 week for QA. That puts us at a 7-week project duration.
Marcus: That's longer than I was hoping for. Is there any way we can compress that timeline? Marketing is planning a campaign for early June.
Priya: We could potentially overlap some of the design and development work, but that increases the risk of rework.
Alex: I'm comfortable starting development on some components while we're finalizing others. We already have solid design principles established.
Sarah: Good suggestion. Let's plan for a phased approach, starting development after the first week of design. Priya, can you identify which components would be safe to begin work on early?
Priya: Yes, I'll create a dependency map this afternoon and share it with the team.
Sarah: Great. Let's also establish our success metrics. Marcus, what specific KPIs should we be tracking?
Marcus: The primary metrics are user retention, time spent in app, and checkout completion rate. We're aiming for a 15% improvement across all three.
Alex: I'd like to add error rate on the checkout flow as well. That's been a consistent problem area.
Sarah: Noted. I'll document these objectives in our project charter. Any questions on scope or timeline before we move on to resource allocation?
Priya: Do we have budget for additional QA support? With the compressed timeline, having dedicated testers would help tremendously.
Marcus: I can approve 40 hours of contract QA support. Just send me the request by end of day.
Sarah: Perfect. Let's move on to our risk assessment...
